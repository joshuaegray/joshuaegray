## Hi, I'm Josh

I'm a second-year Computer Science major at the University of California, Santa Barbara with a strong interest in software engineering and computer architecture. I enjoy building systems from the ground up, having worked on full stack applications, backend systems, and emulators.

I'm currently working as a Computer Architecture Researcher in the UCSB ArchLab with Professor Balkind. My research specifically focuses on hardware accelerators and the optimizations designed for their unique micro-architectures.

This past summer, I worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineering Intern for a startup called ConstructWise, an AI-powered app that automates the construction planning process.
